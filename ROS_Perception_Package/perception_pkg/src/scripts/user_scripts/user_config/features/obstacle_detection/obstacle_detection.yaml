# Config file for Obstacle Detection at Sensor Level

###### General Instructions ######
# This serves as a user-configuration file, where user can input all the necessary information to activate the object detection using a LiDAR

# Occupancy Grid Map Properties
# Please DO NOT change the values given below, if you plan to use object-detection as well!

#### Instructions ####
# This is to define how the real map-area correspond to the pixel-area of the image.
# For example: To correspond 0.03 (m) by 0.03 (m) to an image area of 2 pixels by 2 pixels,
# provide OGM_GRID_SIZE as [0.03, 0.03] and OGM_GRID_TO_PX as [2, 2]

# Occupancy Grid Map Properties
OGM_GRID_SIZE: [0.03, 0.03]   # mxm  (Use [0.03, 0.03] for object detection)
OGM_IMG_SIZE: [416, 416, 3]
OGM_GRID_TO_PX: [2, 2]        # (Use [2, 2] for object detection)
