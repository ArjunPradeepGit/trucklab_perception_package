# Config file for DC-1

###### General Instructions ######
# This serves as a user-configuration file, where user can input all the necessary information to activate the
# perception system of distribution center (DC). The user is expected to input the composition of the DC.
# Here, the DC is composed of vehicles and infrastructures.
# Each vehicle is composed of LiDARs, cameras, odometry and imu sensors
# Each infrastructure is composed of LiDARs, cameras and OptiTrack sensors
# Please note that though the OptiTrack sensor is part of infrastructure, the sensing is done for each vehicle, and becomes part of each vehicle.

###### Instructions for ID numbers ######
# DC_"i" --> "i" is the id number of distribution center
# VEHICLE_"i" --> "i" is the id number of vehicle
# INFRASTRUTURE_"i" --> "i" is the id number of infrastructure
# LIDAR_"i" --> "i" is the id number of LiDAR
# CAMERA_"i" --> "i" is the id number of camera
# NAMESPACE --> is the name-space (string) used to define the ROS topic of that respective item
# Unit type while invoking scripts --> 'v' for vehicle, 'i' for infrastructure
